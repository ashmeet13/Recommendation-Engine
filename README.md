# Recomendation Engine

CollabFilter - Jester:     
* Jupyter Notebook that is coded to perform Collabrative Filtering based on
* User Ratings on the Jester Dataset.

	`The dataset used is a smaller version of actual Jester with ratings only from 2000 users.`


CollabLibrary - Jester:   
* Jupyter Notebook that uses two libraries for Collabrative Filtering.
	1. Surprise-
		Using Singular Value Decomposition(SVD)
	2. Fast.ai-
		- Using Embedding Dot Base Model
		- Using Embedding NN Base Model


	`The dataset used is a smaller version of actual Jester with ratings only from 2000 users.`

ContentBased - MovieLens:
* My first attempt Jupyter Notebook in exploring Recomendation Systems
* Coded using Numpy and Pandas it performs content based recomendation on the basis of:
	1. User Attributes.
	2. Item Attributes.

	`The dataset used is MovieLens.`
